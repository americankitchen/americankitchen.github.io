The American Kitchen is a food kitchen run for Gazans by Gazans in Al Mawasi. As a community initiative run entirely by local volunteers, it alleviates the stigma and demoralizing effect of needing to rely on foreign aid. Instead, Gazan volunteers have the chance to serve each other, cooking up nutritious, protein-based meals similar to what they were able to make before the war, fostering both bodily and emotional health.

The Kitchen is not run through an NGO and no one involved takes a salary. All donations go straight to kitchen and food supplies. As winter approaches and food costs rise, organizers hope that by shouldering the burden of food costs, more families will be able to afford warm clothing.
